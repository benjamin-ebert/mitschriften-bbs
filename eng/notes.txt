### Übung

Ebook Reader
- small computer for reading digital books (ebooks)
- name: electronic book reader -> a device that reads electronic books
- started to become a thing with amazons kindle about 2010
- can hold all your books
- lighter weight than most books, very portable
- battery lasts weeks or even months
- pretty cheap, especially if bought second hand
- can mark text and make notes
- contains dictionaries for most languages -> can look up a word and show a
  short explanation when you move the cursor to that word while reading
- reading layout, fonts etc. are customizable - you could make it so small that
  you now always had a reason to read with your magnifier, if you're into that

  you can make it so small, you'll never have to defend yourself again for using a
  magnifier for reading - that feature alone will bring more peace into
  your life.
- looks like paper, doesn't feel like looking at a screen
- glows in the dark - good bye, dreaded reading lamps!
- if you're short on cash you can download your books for free illegally,
  which is more convenient than physically stealing books from the book store
